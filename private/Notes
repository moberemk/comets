Issues
------

- Cannot use a dash in a template name; would be nice?
- No clear way to exclude files from the build path; a naming convention such as underscored names would be ideal here? Or maybe just store them in an outside directory

Coolness
--------

- Holy shit it reloads the page when I edit files this is witchcraft
